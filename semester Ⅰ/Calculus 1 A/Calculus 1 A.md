### Week 1

#### Definition of Function(DF)

- each element in **domain** has a related element in $D$
- exactly **one** related element.

#### Codomain & Range (CR)

- each element in **range** can be $f(x)$ï¼Œwhen $x \in \text{domain}$
- **codomain** does not need it. 


#### There are four ways to Represent a function:

- verbally (*by a description in words*) 

- numerically (*by a table of values*) 

- visually (*by a graph*) 

- algebraically (*by an explicit formula*)



**Polynomial** of third degree.
