1. Classify some of the devices that serve as sending and receiving devices. (8 marks)

- servers, 
- desktops,
- laptops, 
- tablets,
- smartphones and headsets,
- portable media players,
- handheld game devices,
- GPS receivers in vehicles.

2. Classify and define network transmission directions.
- Simplex transmission 

  - one way transmission only

- Half-duplex transmission

  - one way transmission at a time

- Full-duplex transmission

  - both ways transmission at the same time

3. Draw and define the type of connections
- Circuit-switched
  - Dedicated path over a network is established and all data follows that path
- Packet-switched
  - Messages are separated into small units called packets and travel along the network separately
- Broadcast
  - Data is sent out to all other nodes on the network

4. Wired network transmission media can be classified and define as…(9 marks)

 - Twisted-pair cable
 - Coaxial cable
 - Fiber-optic cable

5. Define what is radio signal and classify it in general. (4 marks)
 - Short-range (e.g. Bluetooth) can connect a wireless  keyboard or mouse to a PC 
 - Medium-range (e.g. Wi-Fi) are used for wireless LANs and to connect portable PC users to the Internet at public hotspots 
 - Longer-range (e.g. WiMAX) can be used to provide Internet access to wide geographic areas

6. Define what is microwave transmissions in general. (5 marks)

 - High-frequency radio signals
 - a high-speed signal transmission 
 - Sent and received using microwave stations or satellites 
 - Microwave stations are earth-based and can transmit signals to each other over distances of about 30 miles 
 - Signals are line of sight, so stations are usually built on tall buildings, towers, mountaintops

7. Network standards can be classify and define as…(6 marks)

 - IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)
 - Communications protocol:
 - Ethernet
 - TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
 - Wireless Application Protocol
 - WiFi
 - WiMAX
 - Mobile-Fi
 - Bluetooth
 - Ultra Wideband

8. Draw the topology of basic networking concepts and elaborate each topology in detail. (9 marks)

 - Bus topology(拓扑)

 - Ring topology(拓扑)

 - Star topology(星形拓扑结构)

9. Define what is internet service provider and domain name services. (4 marks)
 -  provides access to the Internet for private individuals and organizations
 -  provide addressing information

10. Wide area networks can be define and classify as

- Wired connection 
- Connected computers, located at great distanes 
  - Examples: across state, country, or world
- Dedicated point-to-point lines
- Store-and-forward, packet-switched
